# pingPong

`pingPong(device, opts)` creates a double-buffered pair of ordinary VGPU
resources for iterative simulation passes. One half is `read` (sample, bind, or
draw from the previous step) and the other is `write` (render, store, or copy the
next step into). Call `swap()` exactly once after each encoded step so `read`
always points at the latest completed state.

The helper owns only the parity bit and resource lifecycle. It does not cache
bind groups, infer pipeline layouts, or preserve contents across resize; both
halves remain normal `Texture` or `Buffer` instances that consumers bind
explicitly.

## Overloads

```text
const textures = pingPong(device, textureOptions); // TextureOptions -> TexturePingPong
const buffers = pingPong(device, bufferOptions);   // BufferOptions -> BufferPingPong
```

- `TextureOptions` creates two `Texture` halves. Explicit `kind` determines the spatial
  size: `[width]`, `[width, height]` or `[width, height, depth]`. Arrays use a 2D size
  and a separate required `layers` count, preserved across resize.
- `BufferOptions` creates two `Buffer` halves. `size` is the byte length.
- Runtime dispatch follows the option shape: numeric `size` is a buffer;
  tuple `size` is a texture.
- When `label` is provided, halves are labeled `${label}.ping` and
  `${label}.pong`. Without a label, both halves remain unlabeled.

## Contract

- `read`: the current half to sample, bind as input, or draw from.
- `write`: the other half to render, store, or copy into.
- `swap()`: flips `read` and `write`; call once per encoded simulation step.
- `reset()`: restores initial parity (`read` is the `.ping` half). Use before
  re-seeding for deterministic restarts.
- `resize(size)`: reallocates both halves when the size changes, resets parity,
  and returns `true`. Contents are lost, so a `true` return signals callers to
  re-seed. Returns `false` when size is unchanged.
- `destroy()` / `[Symbol.dispose]()` destroy both current halves once;
  idempotent.
- Calling `resize()` after `destroy()` throws `PingPong is destroyed`.

Texture halves have no `resize()`: resize through the pair. Its kind, layers, format,
usage, mip count and sample count stay fixed. A successful resize destroys both old
textures and resets parity; explicitly rebind the new halves and reseed their contents.
Texture-pair preparation is synchronous: if creating either replacement throws, any
partial allocation is cleaned and the old pair, size, contents and parity stay intact.
Errors reported later by native WebGPU are not rollback-safe and use normal device
error reporting. These preparation guarantees describe the texture overload, not the
buffer overload. There is no asynchronous/checked resize variant.

## Texture example

```text
import { pingPong, type Device } from "@vgpu/core";

function reactionDiffusion(device: Device, width: number, height: number) {
  const state = pingPong(device, {
    kind: "2d",
    label: "gray-scott",
    size: [width, height], // `[width, height, depth]` also works for 3D sims
    format: "rgba16float",
    usage: ["texture_binding", "storage_binding", "copy_dst"],
  });
  seedTexture(state.read);

  const nextSize = [width * 2, height * 2] as const;
  if (state.resize(nextSize)) {
    seedTexture(state.read);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    const bindGroup = makeStepBindGroup(state.read, state.write);
    dispatchStep(bindGroup);
    state.swap();
  }

  display(state.read);
  return state;
}
```

## Buffer example

```text
import { pingPong, type Device } from "@vgpu/core";

function boids(device: Device, count: number) {
  const stride = 32;
  const particles = pingPong(device, {
    label: "boids",
    size: count * stride,
    usage: ["storage", "vertex", "copy_dst"],
  });
  seedParticles(particles.read);

  const nextCount = count * 2;
  if (particles.resize(nextCount * stride)) {
    seedParticles(particles.read);
  }

  const bindGroup = makeParticleStepBindGroup(particles.read, particles.write);
  dispatchParticleStep(bindGroup);
  particles.swap();

  drawParticles(particles.read);
  return particles;
}
```
