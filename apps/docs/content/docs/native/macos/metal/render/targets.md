title: "Render to multiple textures"
description: "Connect WGSL fragment outputs to application-owned Metal color attachments, including sparse locations."

A fragment shader can write more than one result in a draw. Declare the outputs in WGSL, then
connect each output location to the same color-attachment index in your Metal pipeline and render
pass. The generated package exposes the functions; your application owns the textures and pass.

## Declare two outputs

```wgsl
// shaders/layers.wgsl
struct LayersOutput {
  @location(0) color: vec4f,
  @location(1) mask: vec4f,
}

@vertex
fn vertex_main(@location(0) position: vec2f) -> @builtin(position) vec4f {
  return vec4f(position, 0.0, 1.0);
}

@fragment
fn fragment_main() -> LayersOutput {
  return LayersOutput(vec4f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0), vec4f(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0));
}
```

Select `vertex_main` and `fragment_main` in a program named `Layers`, as in
[Render WGSL with Metal](/native/macos/metal/rendering). That guide also supplies the `device`,
two-component `vertices` descriptor, and fullscreen `vertexBuffer` used below.

## Match the pipeline attachments

```swift
import Metal
import AppShaders

let layers = try Layers.load(device: device)
let descriptor = MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor()
descriptor.vertexFunction = layers.vertex
descriptor.fragmentFunction = layers.fragment
descriptor.vertexDescriptor = vertices
descriptor.colorAttachments[0].pixelFormat = .rgba8Unorm
descriptor.colorAttachments[1].pixelFormat = .rgba8Unorm
let pipeline = try device.makeRenderPipelineState(descriptor: descriptor)
```

Each format describes a target, not a generated resource. The format must be compatible with the
shader output and the texture attached when you draw. Configure blending and write masks through
the same native descriptors when needed. See Apple's
[pipeline color attachments](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlrenderpipelinedescriptor/colorattachments).

Create the two textures on your device:

```swift
let target = MTLTextureDescriptor.texture2DDescriptor(
  pixelFormat: .rgba8Unorm,
  width: 64,
  height: 64,
  mipmapped: false
)
target.storageMode = .private
target.usage = [.renderTarget]
let color = device.makeTexture(descriptor: target)!
let mask = device.makeTexture(descriptor: target)!
```

The short example assumes allocation succeeds. Both textures use the same dimensions and sample
count. Add the native usage flags required by later work, such as `.shaderRead` for sampling.

## Draw into both textures

With an application-owned `commandBuffer`, attach the textures and encode one draw:

```swift
let pass = MTLRenderPassDescriptor()
pass.colorAttachments[0].texture = color
pass.colorAttachments[0].loadAction = .clear
pass.colorAttachments[0].storeAction = .store
pass.colorAttachments[1].texture = mask
pass.colorAttachments[1].loadAction = .clear
pass.colorAttachments[1].storeAction = .store

let encoder = commandBuffer.makeRenderCommandEncoder(descriptor: pass)!
encoder.setRenderPipelineState(pipeline)
encoder.setVertexBuffer(vertexBuffer, offset: 0, index: 0)
encoder.drawPrimitives(type: .triangle, vertexStart: 0, vertexCount: 3)
encoder.endEncoding()
```

After successful submission and completion, covered pixels are opaque red in `color` and opaque
green in `mask`. The application decides whether to sample, copy, present, or keep these textures.
Neither output has to be a drawable or pass through a vgpu-owned target object.

The pipeline describes formats; the [render pass attachments](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlrenderpassdescriptor/colorattachments)
select actual textures, load actions, and store actions. Loading the functions does not validate
your future attachments, and successful pipeline creation alone does not prove every shader
output will be stored. Keep all intended output locations configured in both descriptors.

## Preserve sparse locations

Locations are indices, not the order of present outputs. If the shader changes its two locations
to `1` and `4`, change the pipeline and pass attachment indices to `1` and `4` as well. Leave the
unused pipeline formats at `.invalid` and the unused pass textures unset. Do not compact the two
outputs back to `0` and `1`.

This example does not add dual-source blending, multisampling, or depth/stencil support to the
declared compiler profile. Those features have separate language, pipeline, and device contracts.
Multiple color outputs need no new Swift renderer primitive: the composition remains ordinary
Metal code around the generated functions.
