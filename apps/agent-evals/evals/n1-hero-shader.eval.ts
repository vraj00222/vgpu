/**
 * The flagship task: take a plain Next.js hero and give it an animated
 * background shader that leaves a fading trail behind the pointer.
 *
 * The prompt names `npx vgpu` and nothing else, for the same reason
 * `s2-gradient` does: the CLI is the official entry point for agents, so handing
 * it over is the realistic starting condition rather than a leak. Everything
 * downstream stays unsaid — no "WGSL", no `docs`, no `doctor`, no `check`, no
 * `pingPong`, no "use client", no agent-browser, no mention of how to look at a
 * pixel. That chain of guidance is exactly what this run measures.
 *
 * What makes this one different from s2 is that the outcome is verified by the
 * HARNESS, not read out of a file the agent left behind: `agent/lib/verify/
 * n1-hero-shader.mjs` runs inside the live sandbox after the turn ends and
 * rebuilds, serves and hovers the app itself. This eval only reads that
 * verdict. See the README's "Trust model (v0)" for what that still does not
 * prove.
 *
 * FIXTURE NOTE — the seed used to carry five invisible `data-testid="n1-wp-N"`
 * anchor divs for the harness to hover. They are GONE, and must not come back:
 * they were styled `pointer-events: none`, and Playwright's (hence
 * agent-browser's) actionability check refuses to hover an element that cannot
 * receive pointer events, so every hover failed and no pointer event ever
 * reached the canvas. The harness now moves the pointer by COORDINATE along a
 * path derived at runtime from the canvas's own bounding box, so it depends on
 * no markup at all — which is also why the anchors could be deleted rather than
 * restyled.
