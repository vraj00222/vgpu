/**
 * THE FINISHING MOMENT: a working hero is declared done and the agent is asked
 * to get it ready to merge.
 *
 * What this measures is whether, from `npx vgpu`, the agent finds the
 * shipping-to-production guide at the moment it is meant for and then behaves
 * the way it asks: run the correctness gates, measure, apply the free defaults
 * that change no pixels, and PROPOSE (not silently apply) anything that does.
 *
 * The seed (`agent/sandbox/tasks/n2-ship-hero/`) is a Next.js hero that
 * already renders an aurora with vgpu and is deliberately unoptimized in ways
 * the guide's sections 3 and 4 name: no `compile()` pre-warm, three
 * `rgba32float` targets where `rgba16float` would do, a two-pass blur at full
 * resolution, a continuous frame loop. Every one of those is a fork: a free
 * default the agent may apply, or a visible trade it must offer.
 *
 * The prompt names `npx vgpu` and nothing else, per the suite's rule. It also
 * names the deliverable (`PR.md`), because "prepare the PR" without a place to
 * put the description would be graded on a file the agent had no reason to
 * write. It does NOT say "checklist", "optimize", "measure" or "propose".
 *
 * TASK ID `n2-ship-hero` and its control `n3-explore-hero` share one seed and
 * one signal vocabulary (`lib/hero-signals.ts`); read them as a pair.
