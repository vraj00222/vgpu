/**
 * THE CONTROL for `n2-ship-hero`: same seed, same signals, opposite moment.
 *
 * The user is still exploring the look and asks for one visual change. The
 * shipping-to-production guide says, in its own words, not to start the pre-PR
 * checklist unprompted while the user is prototyping. An agent that pre-warms
 * pipelines, downgrades texture formats or writes a PR description here has
 * applied the right guide at the wrong time — and without this task, an agent
 * that ALWAYS optimizes would pass n2 for the wrong reason.
 *
 * Same prompt discipline as the rest of the suite: `npx vgpu` is the only hint.
 * The word "exploring" is the whole signal the agent has to read.
