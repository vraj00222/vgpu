/**
 * HARNESS-SIDE VERIFICATION FOR `n1-hero-shader`.
 *
 * Runs inside the live sandbox right after the agent's turn ends and BEFORE the
 * workspace is tarred, so the eval grades a build/serve/hover pass this code
 * performed itself rather than anything the agent claims to have run.
 *
 * The asymmetry with the agent is deliberate. This code is expected to get
 * `agent-browser` exactly right — every flag repeated on every single call,
 * because a session silently falls back to `about:blank` while still printing
 * `✓ Done` if `--executable-path` is dropped from a later command. The AGENT is
 * expected to discover that friction on its own; that discovery is what the
 * journey milestones measure. Never "help" the agent from in here.
 *
 * Nothing throws past this module's boundary: the whole body runs inside a
 * try/catch and `writeVerdict` always runs in a `finally`, so a losing agent
 * cannot turn a real failure into a reported "infra failure" by corrupting its
 * own workspace (PR #272 review, P1-5) — the exception is recorded as a note on
 * an honest, still-false verdict instead of escaping the hook.
 *
 * Gate-integrity notes (PR #272 review, P0-1/P0-2/P1-2/P1-3):
 * - Every "did the command succeed" question is answered with the sandbox's own
 *   `exitCode`, never a string the command's own (agent-influenced) stdout
 *   happens to contain. There used to be an unanchored `__OK__` substring
 *   marker here; it is gone, along with the `|| true` that made it necessary
 *   (eve's hook-time sandbox session does not throw on a non-zero exit — see
 *   `buildSandboxSession.run` in eve@0.29.5's dist — so nothing was ever bought
 *   by discarding the exit code in the first place).
 * - `next start` is served on a per-run random high port, not the fixed 4173,
 *   and is only trusted once it serves back a per-run random nonce this module
 *   writes into the workspace's `public/` directory before building. A foreign
 *   process the agent leaves listening on a well-known port cannot know either
 *   the port or the nonce in advance, because both are generated after the
 *   agent's turn has already ended. The server's captured pid is also checked
 *   for liveness before its response is trusted.
 * - Every value that did not originate as a literal string constant in this
 *   file is passed through `shellQuote` before being spliced into a command
 *   string (the chromium binary path is resolved from a glob under the sandbox
 *   user's `~/.cache`, a directory the agent controls during its turn).

/**
 * Measures, per capture, how much brighter/darker the pixels NEAR the pointer
 * got compared with pixels FAR from every waypoint. Recorded, deliberately not
 * gated yet (see the README roadmap): a threshold gets to be a gate once a live
 * run has produced these numbers on the real task, not before.
 *
 * PROPOSED THRESHOLD. Three populations measured so far, all in a container
 * against the archived green run's own shipped app, all with this same code:
 *
 *   positive A — pointer hand-driven along this path (Phase 1, by hand):
 *     near 67.45-102.53, far 2.54-2.66, ratio 25.49-40.32 at all five
 *     waypoints; largest changed pixel 5-23 px from the commanded coordinate.
 *   positive B — this module's own rehearsal against the same app:
 *     near 51.07-85.06, far 3.01-5.86, ratio 14.52-18.22 at all five
 *     waypoints; largest changed pixel 7-14 px away.
 *   negative — the SAME app with its pointer listeners removed, so it renders
 *     and animates but cannot react (which is the state the archived green run
 *     was actually in: every hover refused by the `pointer-events: none`
 *     anchors): near 2.87-4.17, far 3.31-3.46, ratio 0.85-1.26; largest changed
 *     pixel 121-783 px away. The archived run's own captures measure the same:
 *     near 2.59-4.26, far 2.90-3.54, ratio 0.89-1.20.
 *
 *   => `ratio >= 4` at every waypoint. That is 3.6x below the weakest positive
 *      (14.52) and 3.2x above the strongest negative (1.26) — on a log scale
 *      almost exactly between them — and being a RATIO it cannot be gamed by
 *      making the whole background flicker harder, since that lifts `far` too.
 *   => optional companion, if a stricter spatial claim is wanted:
 *      `maxDeltaOffset <= 0.1 * min(canvas.w, canvas.h)` (69 px at the observed
 *      1050x693) — 4.9x above the worst positive (14 px) and 1.75x below the
 *      best negative (121 px).
 *   => `far` on its own is NOT a threshold candidate: it is the background's
 *      own noise floor and it is nearly identical (2.5-5.9) whether or not the
 *      pointer works. Only the near/far RELATION separates them.
