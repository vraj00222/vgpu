# Direct Tint source build

This maintained build recipe produces the pinned compiler worker from Tint's direct CMake targets
for both macOS architectures, without linking Dawn's WebGPU implementation, runtime backends, or
monolithic release library. Its accepted source, toolchain, and output evidence are preserved below.

## Result

Yes, for the pinned source and toolchain profile. The worker declares only `tint_api` as its link
root. CMake resolves that root to 54 static archives: 44 Tint archives, nine Abseil archives, and
`dawn_shared_utils`. The final executables load only `libc++` and `libSystem`; they contain no Metal
framework, Dawn backend, WebGPU, SPIR-V, GLSL, HLSL, command-tool, or monolithic-library dependency.

Four clean Release builds passed: A and B for `arm64`, then A and B for `x86_64`. The independent
builds were byte-identical within each architecture. Combining each pair with `lipo` also produced
byte-identical universal executables.

The accepted baseline includes the exact shader-interface handshake, the versioned Metal
immediate-data layout, authenticated entry inventory, and semantic extraction for fixed-size
resources, runtime-sized storage graphs, and exact static overrides. It passed the ordinary
publication gate after an independently reviewed candidate rebaseline. Candidate generation
remains a separate non-publishing mode described below; measurements do not become accepted
provenance by themselves.

| Output    |      Bytes | SHA-256                                                            |
| --------- | ---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| arm64     |  6,105,504 | `140be4d7a517a5de1d9dcaa188d7a2c71975de5d3fa354e58375ec31af191e7b` |
| x86_64    |  7,203,664 | `066a37e056bca72dd75697fdf36e5a3053bf7a055f8f2af6600d17efc907d2df` |
| universal | 13,314,464 | `448af648d70941a278d627809c9ab65b8ce52e8cb09c9c9fca13d592978cc8eb` |

The gate does not treat one of the new builds as its own oracle. It first compiles the same worker
against the previously verified monolithic release archive. The locked request closure contains
twenty-three canaries. Ten translation canaries cover the original `noop`, `runtime-array`, `wgsl-error`,
and `generate-failure` cases plus checked-in vertex, fragment, scalar-fragment, compute-builtin,
dual-source, and semantic-interface-mismatch requests. Four authenticated inventory canaries add an
empty module, a library-only module, invalid WGSL, and a multi-stage module. They establish empty
inventories, structured parse failure, canonical entry-point names and stages, and the request identity
`SHA-256(UTF-8("vgpu-native-tint-entry-inventory-request-bytes/v1") || 0x00 || exact encoded request bytes)`.
Nine semantic-extraction canaries add exact render and compute interfaces, one exact fixed-resource
graph, one exact runtime-sized storage graph, and five successful exact-static override profiles. The
override profiles cover the default active case, every supported scalar kind, configured initializer
bypass and dependency evaluation, authored numeric IDs, selected and default values, resolved
workgroup dimensions, and a render program whose entry-local subsets form one canonical program
union. The fixed-resource canary covers numeric binding order through binding ten, per-entry active
subsets, one sampling pair, and content-addressed fixed buffer types and layouts. The runtime-sized
canary covers a fixed struct prefix followed by `array<Particle>`, the compiler-owned array stride,
the zero-element layout minimum, an explicit element-layout edge, and the one-element minimum
binding size.
Each response must match the same reference byte for byte across eight direct variants: both thin
A/B builds, both universal A/B builds, and each applicable arm64-native or x86_64-Rosetta execution
mode. The last original translation request retains a historical fixture name; the real worker
successfully translates it, and all variants agree on that success. The monolithic executable is
reference-only: it is neither copied into `.artifacts` nor a candidate for distribution.

In normal mode, before loading the oracle helper, the gate authenticates all twenty-three local oracle
inputs: both provenance manifests, the helper, the translation and origin-map protocol modules, all
three contract families' request and response schemas, the shared origin-map schema, the inventory
and semantic-extraction protocol modules, both semantic graph validators, and the seven semantic
response oracles. It also authenticates the exact twenty-three-request closure. It
validates each request and response against its authenticated JSON Schema, then runs the corresponding
JavaScript semantic validator in addition to the independent native decoder.
Translation assertions require the exact sparse vertex attributes, sparse fragment colors, fragment
and compute builtins, scalar locations, dual-source color/index pairs, and mismatch diagnostic.
Inventory assertions require the empty-module and library-only results, invalid-WGSL diagnostic,
canonical multi-stage names and stages, and request identity derived from the exact encoded bytes.
Semantic-extraction assertions require exact program-scoped interfaces, fixed and runtime-sized
resource graphs, and each override union, per-entry subset, scalar representation, selected/default
value, authored ID, and resolved workgroup dimension. Common byte parity therefore cannot bless a
canary that stopped exercising its intended branch. Each oracle response must also match its locked
byte count, SHA-256, and success state before any direct worker can use it as a reference.

Candidate mode does not treat changed helper, protocol, schema, or request bytes as authenticated
by the stale lock. It measures their exact bytes before use, requires them to remain identical
through the final input recheck, and emits those measurements only for human review. Hard-coded
fixture expectations and immutable provenance checks remain independent constraints.

## Build boundary

[`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt) accepts three source roots:

- a Dawn checkout at the exact locked commit and tree;
- a JsonCpp checkout at the exact locked commit and tree; and
- the neighboring real worker sources from `c1-compiler-protocol`.

The MSL writer and WGSL reader are enabled, while Dawn's Metal backend is disabled. Those are
different layers: Tint emits MSL text without creating a Metal device or linking a Metal framework.
Every other writer, reader, runtime backend, test, benchmark, fuzzer, sample, command-line tool,
Node binding, install surface, and monolithic target is disabled.

The direct target must be compiled inside Dawn's source graph. Dawn does not install or export this
complete Tint target closure, so collecting loose `libtint_*.a` files would recreate dependency
ordering and transitive-link behavior outside its owner.

`TINT_ENABLE_IR_VALIDATION_ASSERTS` remains off in this distribution profile. The current worker
also leaves `Module.enable_validation_asserts` off when it lowers a program, so changing only the
build feature would not enable the intended checks. Enabling both belongs in a separate compiler
hardening experiment.

## Reproduce

The runner never downloads, installs, fetches, or mutates dependencies. Prepare the locked inputs
out of band, then pass their paths explicitly:

```bash
bash tooling/native-tint-worker/c1-tint-direct-build/run.sh \
  --dawn-root .context/native-spikes/dawn-8f25-source \
  --jsoncpp-root .context/native-spikes/jsoncpp-1.9.8 \
  --release-root .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-standalone/extracted/Dawn-8f25b9c7064ae89802c8db4e7daab9d1fd3e77ca-macos-latest-Release \
  --compat-include .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-standalone/wrapper-prototype/include \
  --sdk-root /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.5.sdk \
  --cmake .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-direct-build/tools/bin/cmake \
  --ninja .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-direct-build/tools/bin/ninja \
  --python /usr/bin/python3 \
  --jobs 8
```

### Measure a lock candidate

When the tracked lock is stale because the previously locked worker, protocol helper, schemas, or
intended request set changed, run the same command with a new output path below `.context`:

```bash
bash tooling/native-tint-worker/c1-tint-direct-build/run.sh \
  --dawn-root .context/native-spikes/dawn-8f25-source \
  --jsoncpp-root .context/native-spikes/jsoncpp-1.9.8 \
  --release-root .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-standalone/extracted/Dawn-8f25b9c7064ae89802c8db4e7daab9d1fd3e77ca-macos-latest-Release \
  --compat-include .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-standalone/wrapper-prototype/include \
  --sdk-root /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.5.sdk \
  --cmake .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-direct-build/tools/bin/cmake \
  --ninja .context/native-spikes/c1-tint-direct-build/tools/bin/ninja \
  --python /usr/bin/python3 \
  --jobs 8 \
  --emit-lock-candidate .context/c1-tint-direct-build-source-lock.candidate.json
```

Candidate mode still builds the monolithic oracle, both A/B thin workers, and both universal
workers; executes native and Rosetta parity; validates the exact semantic evidence; and rechecks
all source and closure inputs at the end. It keeps commits, trees, DEPS, licenses, the configuration
manifest and closure, toolchain, SDK, target, flags, architectures, object count, archive order,
dynamic-library boundary, and configure-only SPIRV-Headers closure strict. It may measure only the
current worker, helper, protocol, and schema bytes; the hard-coded request migration; canary
response goldens; direct binary goldens; and the compiled source closure reached from pinned
repositories. All four builds must report the same compiled closure before those measurements can
become a candidate.

Candidate generation requires the runner, base lock, local worker, helper, protocol, schemas, and
request files to be committed: their worktree bytes and executable modes must match their exact
stage-zero `HEAD` entries. Every worker file discovered by the compiled closure receives that same
check, so a new dirty or untracked header cannot enter a candidate through Ninja. Every selected
Dawn/Tint, Abseil, and JsonCpp compile input is likewise checked against its pinned checkout. This
allows the selected compiled path set to evolve without allowing dirty dependency bytes to enter a
new aggregate. The checks disable lazy fetches and use explicit literal paths rather than a broad
status scan, preserving the partial-clone boundary.

The lock stores only compiled-closure aggregates. If a candidate changes the Dawn/Tint, Abseil, or
JsonCpp aggregate rather than only the worker aggregate, rerun with `--keep-builds` and inspect the
Ninja input paths before approving it; the candidate JSON alone is not sufficient human-review
evidence for that dependency-closure change.

The output must not already exist, its real parent must be below this repository's `.context`, and
`.artifacts` must be absent. Candidate mode never deletes or publishes `.artifacts` and never edits
the tracked lock. It also verifies that the tracked lock did not change while the run was in
progress, constructs the proposed lock, and rejects any JSON-pointer diff outside the explicit
mutable allowlist before creating the candidate with exclusive-write semantics.

In either mode, the effective scratch parent—an explicit `--scratch-root` or the platform temporary
directory—must be outside `.artifacts` and the invocation-lock directory. This keeps retained build
trees from colliding with publication state or preventing sentinel cleanup.

Candidate and publication runs share an atomic invocation-lock directory below `.context`, acquired
before either mode inspects `.artifacts` or reads the source lock. A concurrent run fails without
touching the other run's state. A process crash can intentionally leave this sentinel stale; verify
that no gate is still running before removing the path named by the error and trying again.

The candidate is review material, not a passing gate. Review its diff against
`provenance/source-lock.json`, copy it there explicitly only after the changes are understood, then
rerun the command without `--emit-lock-candidate`. Only that ordinary run can publish a new
`.artifacts` result.

The accepted profile is CMake 3.31.6, Ninja 1.13.2, Python 3.9.6, Apple Clang 17.0.0 build
1700.6.3.2, C++20, the macOS 14.5 SDK, and a `14.0` deployment target. The direct workers therefore
target macOS 14 even though this complete gate currently requires an arm64 macOS 26 host: the
reference release itself has a macOS 26 minimum. The host must also run x86_64 code through Rosetta.
The runner checks the exact first version line for both Clang drivers and Python. Each CMake
invocation receives explicit SDK, compiler, Python, and deployment-target paths or values.

The gate verifies source commits and Git tree objects without running a broad `git status` that can
fetch missing blobs from a partial clone. Before executing CMake, it authenticates the checked-in
manifest and its exact 156-file configuration closure. The generated Ninja graph must then name
that same source set, the fixture `CMakeLists.txt`, and no external inputs outside the selected
CMake installation or build root. It also authenticates 922 compiled source/header files feeding
408 valid dependency objects. The compiled closure is 804 Dawn/Tint files, 97 Abseil files, 15
JsonCpp files, and six worker files. SPIRV-Headers contributes one `CMakeLists.txt` during
configuration and zero compiled headers or linked objects. The runner checks those closures again
after execution and before publication.

All source and build prefixes are normalized at compile time. The gate rejects a binary that
contains any of the physical Dawn, JsonCpp, worker, or build paths, so changing where the pinned
inputs are materialized neither changes the output nor discloses the local checkout location.

It also verifies the CMake cache, all 549 compile commands, the six direct worker objects, the exact
order and hash of 54 static archives, Mach-O load commands, dynamic libraries, native/Rosetta
execution, rebuild hashes, and request/response bytes. An ordinary publication run invalidates
`.artifacts/` before beginning, so an interrupted or failed run cannot leave an older PASS visible.
On success it writes the three binaries, `observed.json`, and the Dawn/Tint, Abseil, and JsonCpp
license notices to a sibling staging directory, then publishes the whole directory with one rename.
Candidate mode instead requires `.artifacts` to be absent and leaves it absent. Use `--keep-builds`
to retain all four temporary build trees for inspection.

[`provenance/source-lock.json`](./provenance/source-lock.json) is the source-of-truth lock. Dawn's
Chromium Abseil checkout is part of the static link. SPIRV-Headers is required by Dawn's CMake
configuration but contributes no linked object to this profile. SPIRV-Tools is recorded only as an
excluded DEPS pin because SPIR-V validation, readers, writers, and built DXC are all disabled.
JsonCpp uses the neighboring compiler-protocol directory's exact source-closure and license provenance.

## Scope

This proves a source-build and process-execution route, not a final distribution artifact or a
stable upstream ABI. The measured hashes establish repeatability only for the pinned source,
toolchain, SDK, and host. The executables are Release builds but are not size-optimized or stripped.

The monolithic release is deliberately retained only as a behavioral oracle. Its larger WebGPU and
framework closure says nothing about the dependency closure of the direct binaries produced here.

Rosetta validates the x86_64 compiler process and byte parity. It does not test an Intel or AMD GPU.
This direct-build gate stops at MSL text and does not itself invoke Apple's offline compiler or a
Metal device. The current `packages/native` tests separately exercise real WGSL translation,
offline compilation, and GPU consumers for their supported profiles. Those cases do not establish
offline-compiler coverage for the full corpus accepted by this worker.

The resolver now records exact authored entry-declaration spans with 1-based locations, UTF-16 code
unit columns, and end-exclusive boundaries. Tint diagnostics remain ranges in resolved virtual WGSL
with UTF-8 byte columns; recovering general authored diagnostic positions beyond proven module
identity remains open, and consumers must not combine those coordinate systems.
